# Pothole-detection-system
This project proposes a cost-effective solution is presented to find potholes and alert of them to the driver. The depth of the potholes on the road can be effectively measured using
an Ultrasonic sensor and a GPS receiver is used to get the current location of the pothole through co-ordinates.
This information about the pothole is then stored in the database
